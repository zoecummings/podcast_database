DATA 440 (automations and workflow) Final Project

To see how the data is collected view: **get_transcripts.py**
* By running the function 'complete_task(url)' the links to the transcripts will be saved in a txt file called transcript_links.txt and the transcripts themselves will be saved to a file called transcripts.txt
* I need to continue working on this to have the final project save a json file that contains the podcast information as well as the transcription in order to eventually create a database.
