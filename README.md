DATA 440 (automations and workflow) Final Project

To see how the data is collected view: **get_transcripts.py**
* By running the function 'complete_task(url)' the links to the transcripts will be saved in a txt file called transcript_links.txt and the transcripts themselves will be saved to a file called transcripts.txt
* I need to continue working on this to have the final project save a json file that contains the podcast information as well as the transcription in order to eventually create a database.
* In order to test this file, download the get_transcripts.py file and it will start collecting data for the Bobby Bones podcast. You will need to have Google Chrome downloaded. The script will open a seperate Google Chrome window to collect the transcript data. If you intent to let this run through the entirty of the episodes I recommend plugging your laptop in as it tends to drain the battery.
* I intend to edit the code so that each file is saved with the name of the podcast for better organization, as well as more error handling to make sure the data is maintained if the code crashes.
